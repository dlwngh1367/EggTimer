# EggTimer

This is an Egg Timer app that can be used to cook eggs.
You can choose one of soft, medium, and hard to set the time appropriate for cooking as a timer, and when cooking is completed, an alarm will sound with a message at the appropriate time.
To develop this app, I used Swift Dictionaries collection type and controlled the timer using Swift Timer API.
When it comes to Swift UI, the progress view and the appropriate formula were applied to the UI, and AVFoundation and AVaudio Player library were also used to play alarm sounds.
